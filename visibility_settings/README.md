# Visibility Settings

**Note:** This only applies to importing items from Vault.

Before uploading items into Spotlight, you need to set the visibility of all items to be uploaded to "Public" in Vault. Otherwise, you will see the following placeholder image in Spotlight:

You can set visibility individually, item-by-item, or for an entire collection. To learn more about visibility settings in Vault, see the [Vault wiki page](https://github.com/UVicLibrary/Vault/wiki/Visibility-and-Permissions).

When you're finished making items public, check the other items in the pre-flight checklist.
