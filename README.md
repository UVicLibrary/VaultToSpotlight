# Vault to Spotlight

This manual describes the process of migrating data from Vault to Spotlight. [Vault](https://vault.library.uvic.ca) is our software repository for storing and preserving digital artifacts in our collections. [Spotlight](https://exhibits.library.uvic.ca/) is our digital exhibit platform, where we curate, highlight, and create a narrative for specific groups of objects.

For our purposes, we will focus on uploading and exporting data in batches via [CSVs](glossary/README.md#csv), although both Vault and Spotlight support uploading items individually.

If you're looking for Vault-specific information, see the [Vault Wiki](https://github.com/UVicLibrary/Vault/wiki). If you want to report a problem with Spotlight, please do so on the [Issues page](https://github.com/UVicLibrary/Spotlight2_custom/issues).
