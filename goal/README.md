# Goal: Working Towards a Spotlight CSV

The goal of this process for you, the user, is to create one or two [CSVs](../glossary/README.md#csv) (aspecially-formatted spreadsheets), depending on whether you are loading from [Vault](../glossary/README.md#vault) to Spotlight or directly into Spotlight.

Here is an overview of each process:

#### Uploading from Vault
1. Create a CSV called a [mapping document](../mapping_document) which
   * maps human-readable labels from Vault to [Spotlight metadata fields](../how_solr_indexes_metadata)
   * has a [column with URLs](../the_url_column) that link to the IIIF manifest for each object in Vault
2. Go through the [pre-flight checklist](../pre-flight_checklist)
3. When ready, send everything to the developers who will supervise the upload. They will email you once your items are uploaded.

#### Uploading directly into Spotlight**
1. Create a [user document](../user_document) with metadata for your objects
2. Create a [mapping document](../mapping_document) that maps metadata fields in your user document to [Spotlight metadata fields](../how_solr_indexes_metadata)
3. Go through the [pre-flight checklist](../pre-flight_checklist)
4. When ready, send everything to the developers who will supervise the upload. They will email you once your items are uploaded.
