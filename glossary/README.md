#### CSV
CSV stands for comma-separated values. CSVs (i.e. files ending in .csv) function like spreadsheets. Machines can read and manipulate CSVs much faster than you could in Excel, but this also means they are very picky about formatting, encoding, etc. In a CSV, the start and end of each "cell" is denoted by a comma or line break.
