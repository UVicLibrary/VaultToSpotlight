#### CSV
CSV stands for comma-separated values. CSVs (i.e. files ending in .csv) function like spreadsheets. Machines can read and manipulate CSVs much faster than you could in Excel, but this also means they are very picky about formatting, encoding, etc. In a CSV, the start and end of each "cell" is denoted by a comma or line break.

#### Facets (also: facet fields, filter fields)
Facet fields are metadata fields that allow users to filter out certain results from a search. See [facet fields](../facet_fields) for more information.

#### Solr
[Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) is the software that indexes metdata for both Vault and Spotlight. See [How Solr Indexes Metadata](../how_solr_indexes_metadata) for more.
