# User Document

**Note:** This only applies to those loading directly into Spotlight (i.e. **not** from Vault)

The user document is a spreadsheet that contains metadata for your collection and the file path or name of the objects it describes. Since *you* (the user) are creating this document, you can use whatever metadata best describes your objects. However, you might want to preview what metadata terms exist in Spotlight and how they are used so that the upload process goes smoothly. Feel free to include notes for yourself; not all metadata terms need to transfer into Spotlight.

To see a sample user document, [click here]() or on sample.xslx above.
